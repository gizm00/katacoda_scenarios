## Welcome!

This katacoda is a companion to Prototype to Pipeline, an interactive session about building data applications from the ground up. 

You can view the video of this session here <link>
The notebooks are available on github <link> and can be run on binderhub<link>.

The focus of this scenario is illustrating how to run the pipeline discussed in the session, at the end of the Pipeline notebook. You're probably watching a lot of text fly by in the terminal as the environment is being setup, installing dependencies and setting up airflow. If you are interested to learn more about this process, check out [Workflow Orchestration with Airflow](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/build-a-robust/9781098111069/), another Katacoda scenario that walks you through the steps for setting up airflow.

Setup is complete when you see the Airflow logo, which displays when starting the webserver. At this point you can open the Airflow UI [hosted on port 8080](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/)

When you've brought up the Airflow UI you can move on to the next step.
