## Welcome!

This katacoda is a companion to Prototype to Pipeline, an interactive session about building data applications from the ground up.  

You can view the video of this session on the [Strata Data Superstream Recording] (https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/strata-data-superstream/0636920551973/)
The notebooks are available on [github](https://github.com/gizm00/strata_2021) and can be run on [binderhub](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gizm00/strata_2021/main).  

The focus of this scenario is illustrating how to run the pipeline discussed in the session, at the end of the Pipeline notebook. This scenario does **not** cover how to setup Airflow.  

If you are interested to learn more about this process, check out [Workflow Orchestration with Airflow](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/build-a-robust/9781098111069/), another Katacoda scenario that walks you through the steps for setting up Airflow.  

If you have any questions or encounter problems with this scenario please reach out to me at sev @ thedatascout dot com.
